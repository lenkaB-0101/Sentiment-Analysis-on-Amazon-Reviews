This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews from Amazon. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative using machine learning techniques, 
specifically leveraging a pre-trained transformer model (like BERT) fine-tuned on a custom dataset.

Overview

    Data Collection: Reviews were scraped from Amazon using web scraping techniques.
    Data Processing: Texts were preprocessed to be ready for sentiment analysis (removal of special characters, stop words, etc.).
    Model: The sentiment classification was performed using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on the collected Amazon review dataset.
    Web App: A user-friendly interface was created using Streamlit to interact with the model.
