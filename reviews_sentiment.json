        "review": "Short Summary:Worth the money! Purchased for working extended hours outdoors in subpar conditions & for a trip to Alaska. Yes, they are pricier than others. HOWEVER, the saying “you get what you pay for” is positively true!Detailed Summary:My husband (who is hot natured) purchased a set last winter when he was stuck outside at work for extended hours on end in subpar weather. He couldn’t say enough good things about how comfortable & warm they kept him.He was able to comfortably layer them underneath his work clothes and I n no way did they restrict or prohibit any movement nor cause him to sweat when he was working intensely setting & cleaning up trench pumps, boxes, wading through mud with LDH, etc.(For reference he’s 5’12”, 300# & purchased size: 2XL. He wears 3XL shirts & 44 x 32 jeans)Also, due to my husband’s recommendation, purchased a set for my mother to wear in Alaska on her cruise & excursions. For transparency at first she was rather skeptical but after wearing them she’s never wearing anything else! As soon as she could she excitedly sent me a message with the BIGGEST THANK YOU ever for my husband recommending them & me purchasing them for her. She said others were complaining about freezing yet she’s never been so comfortably warm outside in cold weather!Both my mother & husband said they fit more snugly than they were use to how other brands fit. However, that’s how these are intended to fit. Neither of them like clothing to fit tightly… until they wore these & only these! (It’s only my assumption that if your deciding factor on whether or not to purchase them is due to wanting a looser fit that you could, obviously, order up from your normal size. However, in my opinion, I think that’s slightly defeating their purposefully intended design.)Hope this has helped with any decision making information you were looking for!Read more",

There is nothing wrong other than normal wear with the 3.0’s , he just wanted to purchase the 4.0’s since we are going to be in a colder climate than usual for winter ! If the 4.0’s are as good of quality as the 3.0’s, they’re worth every dime ! We purchased from Amazon because they were almost $20 cheaper per item than buying from a stand alone store !! They are great quality, the hubs says they feel great too !!Read more",
